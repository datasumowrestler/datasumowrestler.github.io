<strong>About Me</strong>
<hr>

<p>
I have a passion for working with people and technology. 

Being a firm believer in powering results using data, I thrive at the intersection between business and technology. My next goal is advancing data privacy and security in the information security realm.
</p>

<p>
I'm experienced in data strategy, business analytics, and risk management.
Some of my career highlights:
<ul>
  <li>
    Achieving a $1M ARR milestone for a SaaS start-up through conducting sales analyses, creating customer segmentation profiles, and improving service levels through automation
  </li>
  <li>
    Enabling a $300M global sales dashboard in QlikView for a Fortune 500 company by refactoring and streamlining the data ETL process
  </li>
  <li>
    Creating data sharing standards and devising the data strategy used throughout British Columbia for local government and ride-hail operations such as Uber and Lyft
  </li>
  <li>
    Driving $900M+ in sales for a Fortune 500 company through channel and market sales forecasting, P&L analysis, and customer churn risk management
  </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
During my downtime, I enjoy training my dog, sweating to kickboxing, and building out my home lab.
</p>

<p>
I'm open to new opportunities and happy to chat about how I may be able to address your data concerns. Feel free to reach out to me via email or LinkedIn.
