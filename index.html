<strong>About Me</strong>
<hr>

<p>
Throughout my career journey, I've discovered that I love working with people and technology. I often find myself being a data advocate through mentoring others, promoting best practices, and enabling knowledge sharing. Being a firm believer in powering results using data, I thrive at the intersection between business and technology. My next goal is applying my data skills towards advancing data privacy and information security. 
</p>

<p>
My strengths include data strategy, business analytics, and risk management.
Here are some of my career highlights:
<ul>
  <li>
    Achieving a $1M ARR milestone for a SaaS start-up through conducting sales analyses, creating customer segmentation profiles, and improving service levels through automation
  </li>
  <li>
    Enabling a $XXXM global sales dashboard in QlikView for a Fortune 500 company by refactoring and streamlining the data ETL process
  </li>
  <li>
    Creating data sharing standards and devising the data strategy used throughout British Columbia for local government and ride-hail operations such as Uber and Lyft
  </li>
  <li>
    Driving $XXXM+ in sales for a Fortune 500 company through channel and market sales forecasting, P&L analysis, and customer churn risk management
  </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
During my downtime, I enjoy training my dog, sweating to kickboxing, and building out my home lab.
